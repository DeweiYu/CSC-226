# CSC226 - Algorithms and Data Structures II

## Description  


This course emphasis on varierty of importance oif data structure, alogorithnm and technice assiciated with it.  There is a lot of abstract and theoratical aspect of mathmatical concepts mostly in java

This Course includes:


Markup :* Advanced techniques for design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms and data structures  
Markup :* Algorithmic design paradigms: greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, randomization  
Markup :* Advanced Analysis techniques: amortization and expected running time  
Markup :* Advanced data structures: random hash families, disjoint sets  
Markup :* Advanced graph algorithms: network flow, connectivity, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths  
Markup :* Mathematical tools: graphs and digraphs, graph properties, planar graphs, networks  
Markup :* String search  
Markup :* Data compression
