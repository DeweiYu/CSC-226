# CSC226 - Algorithms and Data Structures II

## Description  

This course emphasis on varierty of importance oif data structure, alogorithnm and technice assiciated with it.  There is a lot of abstract and theoratical aspect of mathmatical concepts mostly in java

This Course includes:

Advanced techniques for design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms and data structures with an introduction to algorithm engineering. Algorithmic design paradigms: greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, backtracking, branch and bound. Advanced Analysis techniques, such as amortization. Advanced data structures: hashing, disjoint sets. Advanced graph algorithms: network flow, connectivity, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths. Mathematical tools: graphs and digraphs, graph properties, planar graphs, networks; discrete probability, counting techniques, recurrences.
